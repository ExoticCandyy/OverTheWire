# Bandit Wargame Walkthrough

Welcome to the **Bandit** wargame from [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).

This game is designed to teach absolute beginners the basics of:
- Linux command line
- Navigating the file system
- Working with permissions, hidden files, SSH, etc.

Each level gives you access to a server via SSH, and your job is to find the password to the next level using clues in the file system.
