## üñ•Ô∏è Steps

1. Open your terminal.
2. Connect to the Bandit server via SSH:

```bash
ssh bandit28@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
3. let's clone the git branch it's same as the previous lvl.
```
bandit28@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/mylvl28
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/mylvl28$ git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit28-git/repo
Cloning into 'repo'...
.
.
.
```
4. as you see in the `README.md` the pass has been censored. one thing we can do is to go and check the previous versions something might come up.
```
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/mylvl28$ cd repo
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/mylvl28/repo$ ls
README.md
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/mylvl28/repo$ cat README.md
