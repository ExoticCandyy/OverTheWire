## üß© Objective

## üñ•Ô∏è Steps

1. Open your terminal.
2. Connect to the Bandit server via SSH:

```bash
ssh bandit19@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
3. the `id` command shows the userId, groupID and the group memberships. so what does  this `bandit20-do` do? we can use this to execute commands in behalf of the user `bandit20`. here you can see we can execute commands and the IDs have been shown here.
```
bandit19@bandit:~$ id
uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) groups=11019(bandit19)
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do 
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do id
uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19) euid=11020(bandit20) groups=11019(bandit19)
```
4. here i can get the password of bandit20 in behalf of user bandit20. and as you know the passwords of these challenges are stored in the `/etc/bandit_pass` dir it's why we're reffering to it.
```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
