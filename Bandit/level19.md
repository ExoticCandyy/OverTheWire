## üñ•Ô∏è Steps

1. Open your terminal.
2. Connect to the Bandit server via SSH:

```bash
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
3. after trying to login we get this. when we use the `ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
` command it uses `/bin/bash` as default to connect. we know that someone messed with `.bashrc` so i will use different shell.
```
.
.
.
Byebye !
Connection to bandit.labs.overthewire.org closed.
```
4. if you want to know what sheel you have just type:
```
‚îÄ[phantom@parrot]‚îÄ[~]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïº $cat /etc/shells
# /etc/shells: valid login shells
/bin/sh
/usr/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/rbash
/bin/dash
/usr/bin/dash
/usr/bin/tmux
/usr/bin/screen
```
5. i'll use `/bin/sh`. as you see it worked.
```
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïº $ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -t "/bin/sh"
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|
